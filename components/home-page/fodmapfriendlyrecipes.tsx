          How do FODMAPs trigger symptoms of IBS?
          <br />
          <br /> When consumed in foods and/or drinks, FODMAPs can be poorly
          absorbed in the small intestine and pass through to the large
          intestine, where two major events happen:
          <br />
          <br />
          The FODMAPs are readily fermented by bacteria in the large bowel,
          contributing to the production of gas. The FODMAPs are also highly
          osmotic, meaning that they attract water into the large bowel, which
          can alter how quickly the bowels move.
          <br />
          <br />
          These two processes can then trigger symptoms including excess wind,
          abdominal bloating and distension, abdominal pain, constipation or
          diarrhoea, or a combination of both. Information about each FODMAP,
          and examples of foods that contain FODMAPs, are listed in the fodmap
          chart below:
